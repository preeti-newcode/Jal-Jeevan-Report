# Jal-Jeevan-Report
Developed an end-to-end interactive Power BI dashboard using authentic government data from the Jal Jeevan Mission, which focuses on providing household tap water connections across rural India. This project involved working with real-world messy datasets, transforming them into meaningful insights to showcase progress from 2019 to 2025.

Key Highlights:

Analyzed tap water connection progress for 194+ million rural households.

Built dynamic dashboards with:

📌 KPI cards highlighting Total Rural Households, Growth from 2019, and Coverage Percentage (80%).

📈 Before vs After comparison (2019 vs 2025) using gauges and area charts.

📊 Year-wise contribution trends using funnel and bar charts.

🗺️ State/UT-wise breakdown with slicers for interactive filtering.

Applied data cleaning, custom DAX calculations, and advanced visualizations in Power BI.

Enhanced my data storytelling skills while gaining experience in social-impact data analytics.
